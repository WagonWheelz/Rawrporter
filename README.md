## 🚀 How It Works

1. The bot pulls fresh headlines.
2. Each headline is filtered for inappropriate content.
3. A headline is OwOified (e.g. "Love" → "Wuv", "R" → "W", etc.).
4. You get to approve or skip the post.
5. If approved, the bot posts it to your Bluesky account with a link preview and thumbnail.

## 🔧 Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

```
   git clone https://github.com/WagonWheelz/Rawrporter.git
```

2. **Install dependencies**
(This failed for me so I had to install each requirement manually)
```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Configure credentials**

   Create a `config.py` file (already included) and place in both your username and your APP password. You will need to generate an app password in bluesky:

```
   USERNAME = "yourhandle.bsky.social"
   APP_PASSWORD = "xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx"
```

4. **Add a thumbnail image**

   Place your preferred image in the bot folder as `thumbnail2.png`
   (This gets uploaded with each post).

5. **Adjust any blocklist settings you want**

   Review the existing blocklist in `news_fetcher.py`

6. **Run the bot**

   In your terminal run `python main.py`, If the setup works correctly, It will run through and pull the articles from the fetcher and prompt you for approval. Select Y or N depending on the approval and then you're ready!

## 🤖 AI Disclosure

ChatGPT was used to beautify the code and develop some functions. This was my first time making a bot of any kind or code of any kind and used ChatGPT to assist me, I then autopsy each request and learn how it works so I can learn for myself next time. I have taken the code ChatGPT provided and streamlined it (I Think) hwoever it works and there may still be issues. I attempted to create this repo and the readme based on other ones i've seen hwoever I may have gotten part of it wrong, ChatGPT was not used for the creation of this readme file.
